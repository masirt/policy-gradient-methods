The code consists of multiple files and folders. The overall structure was done in a way where one can simply loook at the experiments_%environment%.py files to find some of our experiments. However, we also conducted experiments in the provided ipython file. 

Any experiment done for the REINFORCE with baseline algorithm can be found and run in the experiments_%environment$.py files. The other experiments on the One Step Actor Critic algorithm can be found in the jupyter notebook and be rerun there. The results and everything around them are discussed in the report though. If there are any questions or reassurances that have to be made, feel free to contact Marios and Yugantar.
